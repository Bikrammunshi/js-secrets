The web page holds a hidden key,
Just view the source, and you will see,
A tangled Javascript hard to read,
Online tools will meet your need.

Deobfuscation, make it plain,
The answer hides within the chain,
Look for the comments, clear and bright,
The flag's revealed within the light.

No server access, no exploit's trace,
Just client-side, the whining place
Decode the script, the task's begun,
The flag awaits, when you are done.
